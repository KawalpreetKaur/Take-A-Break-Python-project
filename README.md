# Take-A-Break-Python-project
This project schedules and encourages the person to take breaks during work throughout the day.It asks to take break after a particular time period which has been set in the code,like two hours or one hour depending upon the user.


So, after every fixed time period of work it asks to take break and plays some music asking to get some break, enjoy and come back to work. Python has been used to make this project.


Modules like 'time' and 'webbrowser' have been imported in this program. The module 'time' has been imported to handle the time-related tasks and 'webbrowser' module includes functions to open URLs in interactive browser applications. Functions like 'ctime()' , 'webbrowser .open()' and 'sleep()' are used.


Functions 'ctime()' and 'sleep()' are used in the formats 'time.ctime()' and 'time.sleep(time period)' and the time period is in seconds. Function 'time.sleep()' as the name implies, pauses your Python program and this way it is used to pause the program and then 'webbrowser.open(url)' is used to open web url provided in the function. The function 'time.ctime()' is in the program to display that the program was started on that particular time.
